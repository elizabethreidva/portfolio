	<h2>What is a Design Technologist?</h2>
	<section>
		<p>Design technologists have expertise that combines the conceptual creative thinking of a designer with the technical skills of a front-end developer. We have hands-on knowledge of one or more delivery mediums, but also experience working in UX design concepts. We bring technical knowledge to advise designers on how their designs will be implemented, and help developers understand design intent to ensure successful translation to delivery.</p>

		<h3>Design Technologist vs Design Engineer</h3>
		<p>I've gone back and forth on this, because these titles are sometimes used interchangeably. The definitions are still emerging across the software industry. The confusion increases when you start rubbing elbows with non-software engineering, e.g. mechanical, electrical, and so on.</p>
		<p>To borrow from <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=design+technologist+vs+design+engineer">Google's AI Overview</a></p>
		<blockquote cite="https://www.google.com/search?q=design+technologist+vs+design+engineer">
			<p>&ldquo;Design technologists focus on the practical implementation and technical aspects of a design, while design engineers are more involved in the conceptualization, analysis, and overall feasibility of a design.&rdquo;</p>
		</blockquote>
		<p>The AI Overview also offers this side-by-side comparison:</p>

		<p>Based on this summary, I lean more towards design engineer. I want to be a voice in the complete design process, not just how the design gets built. That said, because of the confusion with non-software engineering, I'm seeing a shift towards design technologist as the more common role title. So that's what I'll be using to tell my story.</p>
