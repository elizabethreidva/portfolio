	<h1>Identify Key UX Patterns for a Business Vertical</h1>
	<section>
		<h2>Problem statement</h2>
		
<ul>
	<li>We observed recurring UI/UX challenges across our product suite, with similar problems being solved in different ways. This lack of cohesion resulted in inconsistent user experiences, creating complexity and confusion for end users. The absence of standardized solutions led to redundant work for designers and developers, hindering efficiency.</li>
	<li>We also noticed that solutions did not align with the enterprise design system standard in all cases. Non-compliance with corporate standards created further duplication of work for designers and developers.</li>
</ul>
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Objective</h2>
		
<ul>
	<li>Create a pattern library in design kit and coded components to centralize and standardize the UX patterns common across Risk products</li>
</ul>
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Team</h2>
		
<ul>
	<li>1 Design Engineer (me)</li>
	<li>Contractors for 2 months (1 Designer, 2 Developers)</li>
</ul>
	
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>Methodology</h2>
		
<ul>
	<li>Identify a subset of products for Phase 1 to control scope of inquiry</li>
	<li>Gather reference materials for current and near future user-facing screens across the in-scope products</li>
	<li>Review product screens to identify repeated patterns and patterns with similar intent</li>
	<li>Build a list of candidate patterns to be centralized and standardized</li>
	<li>Catalog examples of these candidate patterns across the in-scope products</li>
	<li>Remove from consideration any candidates that are–or should be–on the roadmap for the enterprise-wide design system, and escalate those to the appropriate team</li>
	<li>Parking lot for later consideration any candidates that are too specialized, e.g. unique to only 1-2 products</li>
	<li>Collaborate with product teams to prioritize remaining pattern candidates by level of need and impact</li>
	<li>Define a file structure in Figma to standardize design process for defining pattern specifications</li>
	<li>Construct a front end project scaffolding to standardize code library development and testing</li>
	<li>Lead each pattern through the design process to define spec requirements and visual design, review with representatives from each in-scope product, make revisions as needed, and seek final approval from key stakeholders</li>
	<li>Build out HTML and CSS to construct the visuals for each approved pattern in reusable code</li>
	<li>Build out JavaScript to utilize the HTML and CSS and package it along with standard behaviors into a reusable code module</li>
</ul>
	
	</section>

		<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
		
<ul>
	<li><p>A pattern library is a solution, not a problem. We accepted the premise of a pattern library as the correct solution, and thus we missed the actual problem–a need to get patterns into the hands of two specific teams ASAP. Although the pattern library was the correct solution for long term sustainability, it did not meet the immediate delivery need.</p>
	<p>Stakeholders did not initially understand the scope and complexity of work needed to establish a pattern library. A successful pattern library is centralized, maintainable, scalable, and provides reusable components for both design kit and code. The result of this misunderstanding was incorrect and varied expectations of what was realistic for a delivery schedule.</p>
	<p>I eventually found an analogy to help the audience understand the scope, but we would have been better served by ensuring all parties were on the same page from the beginning.</p>
	<p><strong>What I’d do differently:</strong> Make sure all parties are in agreement on the problem and the objective at the beginning, and regularly check in to reconfirm the objective and identify shifting needs.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Our project was the first creating a pattern library to inherit from the emerging enterprise design system. We were ahead of any other similar project–and in some cases ahead of the enterprise design system itself–in determining the necessary software architecture to comply with enterprise standards. We found ourselves inventing the car as we drove it down the road to deliver it to the customer. As a result, the startup time extended past original expectations.</p>
	<p><strong>What I’d do differently:</strong> Research the availability of documented software architecture standards during the initial discovery phases and identify expert resources earlier to advise on enterprise compliance standards. Ensure any risk factors due to lack of documentation or resources are fully communicated to stakeholders.</p>
	</li>
	<li><p>Timing of adding additional staff, especially contractors, is critical. In our case, contractors were added with funding availability, not based on when the project was ready for them.</p>
	<p>At the time contractors were onboarded, we lacked many of the design decisions and onboarding documentation needed for a smooth scale-up of staffing. Additional issues with the contractor onboarding meant a developer started before the designer, which further magnified the impact of the absence of approved designs to be coded.</p>
	<p>I had to dedicate the majority of my time to make sure the contractors had tasks to work on and spend more time on oversight than ideal. We didn’t get the full resourcing increase that we should have had.</p>
	<p><strong>What I’d do differently:</strong> Timing and proper planning are key when adding additional staff, particularly contractors. Proper onboarding, having clear design decisions in place, and ensuring the right roles are onboarded in the correct order are crucial to avoid inefficiencies and unnecessary oversight.</p>
