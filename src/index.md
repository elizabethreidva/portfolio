	<h2>Hello, I'm Elizabeth, and I'm a <a href="/definition">Design Technologist</a>.</h2>
	<p>I live on the edge between design and development, bridging the gap between the two. I bring a customer-focused mindset to technical conversations and technical implementation insights to design jams. I help designers and developers understand how their work impacts each other, ensuring smooth collaboration.</p>
	<p>I speak design systems fluently and can build components in Figma or VSCode (or other tool your team prefers). I can rapidly prototype for ideation or produce production-quality code deliverables for launch. I'm passionate about creative problem-solving, and thrive in a team environment where we can bounce ideas around and learn from each other.</p>
	<p>I believe in putting high-quality, accessible user experiences into the hands of customers who need to get things done and move on with their day. I want to help people&mdash;whether thatâ€™s customers out in the world or other members of my team. Great documentation brings me joy when it empowers people to learn and help themselves.</p>
