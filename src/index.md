			<h3>As a designer</h3>
			<p>As a designer, I follow the 'Don't Make Me Think' principle. Great user experience design feels effortless&mdash;users can complete their tasks smoothly, without having to think twice. This is why I’m a strong advocate for design systems. They create simple, consistent experiences, allowing designers to focus on solving more complex user challenges. Recently, I’ve enjoyed contributing to design tools (like Figma components), code libraries, and documentation to help others effectively use design systems.</p>

			<h3>As an engineer</h3>
			<p>Throughout my career, I've worked across various layers of the software stack, but I found my passion in the user interface layer or "front end". This is where customers directly interact with the software to achieve their goals or solve problems. I take pride in building high-quality, functional user interfaces and fine-tuning them to enhance the overall experience. While I enjoy developing for web where most of my UI work has been, I'd welcome the chance to grow into native (iOS/Android) apps as well.</p>
