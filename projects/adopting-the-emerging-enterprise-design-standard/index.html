				<h2>Problem</h2>
				
<ul>
	<li>The emerging enterprise design system was the designated standard for all design work. However, the version in production was outdated and incomplete, while the updated version only existed in design specs, not in code. How can our business vertical achieve compliance with a design standard that exists in design but not in code with minimal development effort?</li>
</ul>
	
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Objective</h2>
				
<ul>
	<li>Propose a solution to balance compliance with the emerging state of the enterprise design system with utilizing existing coded components as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
	
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>Result</h2>
				
<ul>
	<li>This project was still ongoing when I left the company. While we made some progress toward establishing a standard, the constantly shifting and poorly communicated design system release schedule made it challenging to move forward to tangible results.</li>
</ul>

			<section>
				<h2>Process</h2>
				
<ul>
	<li>Review the design specs for the emerging version of the enterprise design system, and prioritize components that are needed for current and near future business vertical UX</li>
	<li>For each component</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Identify which existing coded libraries within the enterprise have an instance of the component. Consider both the legacy enterprise design system and any stable LOB-specific libraries.</li>
			<li>Compare existing code instances against the latest enterprise design system design specs</li>
			<li>Identify which existing code library is the closest match to the the enterprise design system</li>
			<li>Document the differences between the closest match code component and the enterprise design</li>
			<li>Determine the feasibility and level of effort to adapt the closest match code component to the enterprise design</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Validate this approach with business vertical stakeholders and with the enterprise design system team</li>
</ul>
	
			</section>
		</section>

		<section class="tab-content challenges" id="tc-challenges">
			<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
			
<ul>
	<li><p>The enterprise design system libraries were behind schedule, with no clear release roadmap. Designers used the latest specs, unaware that Tech partners lacked corresponding coded components. This disconnect between design and code was poorly communicated to stakeholders, which led to unrealistic expectations of what results were possible from this effort.</p>
	<p><strong>What Iâ€™d do differently:</strong> Ensure stakeholders within our business vertical have an accurate understanding of the status of the enterprise standards up front, and set realistic expectations for what level of compliance is achievable in that current status.</p></li>
